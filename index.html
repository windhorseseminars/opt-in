    <h1>See what previous participants of Fleet's coaching programs and online courses have said about their experience:</h1>

    <p>"Fleet's seminar was a great experience of learning within a community. I still think of his teachings, months later, and I remember my coursemates and hope they are flourishing. Thanks for this experience!" - <strong>Monica Bergers</strong></p>

    <p>After training with Fleet, my life is easier, more fun and I have more clarity and I now get the things I want most out of of my relationships, my life purpose and my heart. - <strong>Liz Carey</strong></p>

    <p>"I began with the [Path of Freedom] course and was so impressed with the content that I went through it several times. [Radical Responsibility] was very similar information. This material is so easy to understand and so concise but also includes all necessary information so anyone can lead a happier life. Taking these classes has been helpful to me personally and I continue to practice and share the information with family and friends. I especially appreciate it when I find myself going into reaction mode. It's easier to get back to a peaceful state of mind." - <strong>Nancy Miller</strong></p>
